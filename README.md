# WebView App

A minimal, modern, cross-platform WebView application built with Kivy and Python. This project is designed to be developed in Termux and built automatically via GitHub Actions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Android (via `pyjnius`) and Desktop (Linux/macOS via `pywebview`).
- **Smart Address Bar:** Functions as both a URL navigator and a search bar.
- **Acts as a Browser:** Registers with the Android OS to open `http`/`httpshttps` links from other apps.
- **In-App Console:** A built-in console displays `console.log` messages from the WebView, available on all platforms.
- **Native Android Debugging:** Forwards all console messages to `logcat` for powerful, PC-free inspection.
- **Live-Reload Server:** Includes a built-in web server and file watcher for rapid offline-first web development.
- **CI/CD Ready:** A pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds a debug APK on every push.
- **Bookmark Manager:** Save, view, and load your favorite URLs.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Local Development (Offline Web Project)

This project includes a live-reload server for developing the web-based parts of your app.

1.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2.  Click the **"Live"** button. This starts a server for the `local_web_project/` directory.
3.  Edit any file inside `local_web_project/` (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`).
4.  The WebView will automatically reload to show your changes.

### Building the APK (CI/CD)

This project is configured to build a debug APK automatically using GitHub Actions.

1.  **Commit and Push:** Push your code to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your changes"
    git push origin main
    ```
2.  **Check Actions:** Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository. A new workflow run will be in progress.
3.  **Download Artifacts:** Once the build is complete, you can download two artifacts:
    -   `webview-app-debug-apk`: Contains the installable `.apk` file.
    -   `buildozer-log`: Contains the complete build log, essential for debugging any failures.
